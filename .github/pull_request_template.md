Submission checklist
--------------------
1. Make sure you have uploaded your candidate model files to the appropriate directories in ``data/coefficients/<product>``
   (``<product>`` is "IGRF", "DGRF" or "SV") using file names in the format ``<product>_<institute>.cof``, e.g. ``DGRF_BGS.cof``.
2. Check that the names and ORCIDs of all contributors to your candidate models are correctly given in the file ``CITATION.cff`` in the root directory. If this is
   not the case, please add or update this information in the file below ``# candidate model contributor``.
