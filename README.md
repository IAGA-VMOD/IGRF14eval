Tests are:

0) Check files are correctly formatted, then:
1) Lowes-Mauerberger power spectra plots 
2) Root-mean-square differences between candidates  
3) Degree correlation plot of differences between one candidate and all others
4) Azimuthal spectra plot of the differences between one candidate and the others
5) Triangle plot of differences between one candidate and the others
6) Spatial maps of comparison in X, Y, Z, Br, Bt, Bp between one candidate and the others

Code based on GitHub repos: IAGA Summer School Python exercises and ChaosMagPy
